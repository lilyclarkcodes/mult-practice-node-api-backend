# Roll the Dice for Multiplication Practice
Roll two 12-sided dice to generate random whole numbers between 1-12 for multiplication practice.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

My goal was to create an app to use with students while tutoring online. Many dice roll videos and games available online use dice with the numbers 1-6. I wanted to create a fun visual to add an element of gaming to our session, as well as include the higher numbers in practice.



## Optimizations
This is optional 

## Lessons Learned:
I wanted the app to provide the product of the two numbers rolled, but not until the user clicked a second button. This ended up being a difficulty in the design of the app, and made me consider remaking the app using client-side JavaScript. I struggled to create a second server response for a second button to be clicked after the first button, but including the results of the first response. I started rethinking my goal - I wondered if it was necessary for this to be a backend app. I wanted to better understand the benefit of each, and when it makes the most sense to use either one. Do I want my server to handle the requests and calculations, or the browser? Does this functionality require a database to store data? Can I create this as a client-side app using local storage to save data between button clicks? What extra options do I have to add on to my app if I use backend? Will I limit myself if I make a client-side app?
